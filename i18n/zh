# Ecosystem Evaluation System

Ecosystem is used to describe the health status of open source community standing from ecology context. We create three top level dimensions: Productivity, Robustness and Niche Creation.

# Dimensions

## [**Productivity**](./productivity/README.md)
Definition: The efficiency with which an ecosystem or project converts inputs into output.
