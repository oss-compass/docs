# Organizations Activity

Organizational activity is used to describe how active organizations are in a community.

# Metrics in the Metrics Model

## Org Count

* Definition: Number of organizations to which active code contributors belong in the past 90 days
* Weight: 32.258%
* Threshold: 30

## Contributor Count

* Definition: Number of active code contributors with organization affiliation in the past 90 days
* Weight: 25.806%
* Threshold: 300

## Commit Frequency

* Definition: Determine the average number of commits with organization affiliation per week in the past 90 days.
* Weight: 25.81%
* Threshold: 800

## Contribution Last

* Definition: Total contribution time of all organizations to the community in the past 90 days (weeks).
* Weight: 16.13%
* Threshold: 200

# Metric Model Algorithm

## Weight

We use [AHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_hierarchy_process) to calculate weight of each metric.

### AHP Input Data
| Metric Name       | Org Count | Contributor Count | Commit Frequency | Contribution Last |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Org Count         | 1.000     | 1.250             | 1.250            | 2.000             |
| Contributor Count | 0.800     | 1.000             | 1.000            | 1.600             |
| Commit Frequency  | 0.800     | 1.000             | 1.000            | 1.600             |
| Contribution Last | 0.500     | 0.625             | 0.625            | 1.000             |

### AHP Analysis Result

| Metrics Name      | Eigenvector | Weight  |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Org Count         | 1.290       | 32.258% |
| Contributor Count | 1.032       | 25.806% |
| Commit Frequency  | 1.032       | 25.806% |
| Contribution Last | 0.645       | 16.129% |

### Consistency Test Results

| Largest Eigenvalue | CI Value | RI Value | CR Value | Consistency Test |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| 4.000              | 0.000    | 0.890    | 0.000    | PASS             |


## Threshold

The threshold we chose is based on the big-data observations from different types of open source projects.
