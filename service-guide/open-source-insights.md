# Open Source Trend Insights Service

The Open Source Trend Insights Service analyzes global open source projects and developer data to provide insights into the development trends of global open source imports/exports, communities, technology domains, developers, programming languages, and licenses. The main data sources are GitHub and Gitee, the two major international and domestic code hosting platforms, containing open source project and developer data from 2022 to 2025, with a data sample size reaching hundreds of millions.

Key services include:

1. **Open Source Contribution Trends** - Code contribution volume (Push frequency) development trends for global TOP30 countries/regions and China TOP30 cities, reflecting actual participation and contribution scale in the open source field.

2. **Active and New Open Source Project Trends** - Development trends of active open source projects (with code commits in the year) and newly added projects (created in the year) for global TOP30 countries/regions, reflecting open source innovation vitality and sustainable development capabilities.

3. **Open Source Import/Export Contribution Trends** - Development trends of open source import/export contributions for global TOP30 countries/regions, reflecting the degree of open source collaboration between countries and regions.

4. **Technology Domain Code Contribution and Developer Trends** - Development trends of global TOP17 technology domains by code contribution, analyzing code contribution volume, active developer count, and new developer count by country/region.

5. **Active and New Developer Trends** - Development trends of active (with code commits in the year) and new (registered and with code commits in the year) open source developers for global TOP30 countries/regions.

6. **Programming Language Active Project Trends** - Development trends of active open source repositories by programming language across different global regions.

7. **License Application and Development Trends** - Development trends of active open source repositories by license across different global regions.

## Features

**1. Multi-dimensional Global Trend Analysis**
Covers six core dimensions: open source project import/export trade, community collaboration patterns, technology domain evolution, developer ecosystem distribution, programming language preferences, and license compliance dynamics.

**2. Dynamic Contribution Quantitative Assessment**
Contribution scale visualization: Monitor code Push frequency for global TOP30 countries/regions and China TOP30 cities; track active and new project counts to measure open source innovation sustainability.

**3. Open Source Collaboration Network Perspective**
Import/export contribution mapping: Quantify open source dependency relationships and collaboration intensity between TOP30 countries/regions through cross-border code collaboration data.

**4. Technology Domain Deep Insights**
Technology track competitiveness analysis: Focus on global TOP17 technology domains, comparing code contribution volume, developer counts, and growth rates across countries.

**5. Technology Preference and Compliance Monitoring**
Language ecosystem mapping: Correlate regional and programming language active repository data to reveal regional technology stack differences.
